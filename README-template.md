## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- javaScript

### What I learned

This one is like a follow-up challenge, in previous one i first time made the side panel appear on click, this one has it same. so that's why that didn't bother me at all and eveything else is fine.

### Continued development

For now i need to start with frontend but i'm going to continue backend devoloping and then if everything goes correctly then will countinue either in robotics coding and developement or in gaming industry.
